# Stargazer Wallet: Yubikey Hardware Wallet Integration

Yubikey Wallet is a cross-chain compatible extension to the Stargazer Wallet that integrates Yubikey as a hardware wallet for Constellation Network. The GPG signature key (Ed25519) stored on the YubiKey is used to extract a DAG-Address and to sign messages and transactions.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several workspaces:

- `yubikey-bridge`: Native messaging host to grant Stargazer Wallet access to a Yubikey. It runs on the host machine and is called by the browser from within the Stargazer Wallet extension. It calls `gpg` to extract the public key stored on the YubiKey and to sign messages with the private key stored on the YubiKey.
- `yubikey-bridge-installer`: Installer for the Yubikey Wallet Native Messaging Host. It builds the `yubikey-bridge` executable and installs it on the host machine. It also registers it as a native messaging host with the Google Chrome browser.
- `stargazer-wallet-ext`: A fork of the Stargazer Wallet browser extension that integrates the Yubikey Wallet as a hardware wallet.
